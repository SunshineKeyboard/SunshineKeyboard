# 🌞 Hi, I’m Sunshine

I build practical Python projects with a focus on clarity, functionality, and real-world problem solving. My work emphasizes clean logic, readable code, and consistent iteration through hands-on development.

I’m comfortable working in the command line, using Git and GitHub for version control, and breaking problems down into manageable, testable steps. I learn best by building, refining, and shipping projects.
